## Credits

Inspired by [samrap's](https://github.com/samrap) awesome [outrun](https://github.com/samrap/outrun-theme-vscode) theme. I edited the theme quite significantly to follow the Cyberpunk 2077 color palette.

If any issues occur or you have ideas for new improvements, please open up a new [issue](https://github.com/endormi/vscode-2077-theme/issues) not a [PR](https://github.com/endormi/vscode-2077-theme/issues/17).
